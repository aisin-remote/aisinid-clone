              The challenges and level of uncertainty that we will face in 2024 will be bigger and higher, so we must
              continue to strengthen and build harmonization of mindsets, participation of all members, synergy and
              collaboration between functions. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our focus [AII-AIIA] is how we improve efficiency and eliminate young operations [TPS, 3 Pillars] so as to
              increase competitiveness in each product. This can be achieved by collaborating and integrating all existing
              functions [Slim Organization]. We optimally use the resources available to us and carry out extra ordinary
              [Change Mindset] activities so that we can increase the expected competitiveness. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
              SDGs and Carbon Neutral activities need to be increased in accordance with the programs we have planned and
              in line with the business situation. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
              We are starting digitalization in all areas to make work easier, integration between parts and easier access
              between functions [No Barrier]. There is no duplicate data procurement, it can be taken from available
              sources. <br><br>

              Resource development is important to form a company culture that is able to compete with rapidly changing
              situations. It is not enough just to provide education, but adequate training must be carried out at all
              levels. So that the sense of belonging to the company can grow and develop in all employees and this company
              will become stronger in facing challenges that are not easy and fast. <br><br>
